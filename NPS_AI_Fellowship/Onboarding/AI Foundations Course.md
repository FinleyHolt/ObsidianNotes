### Lecture 1: Overview

#### Introduction to Machine Learning

* Artificial Intelligence - machines or computers that mimic human intelligence through behaviors which are typically associated with cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving.
* Narrow AI replicate human intelligence on specific tasks or in a limited environment
* Machine learning is a family of algorithms that perform tasks without needing the algorithm to be explicitly programmed by a human. Instead, the decisions of the algorithm are governed by rules that are data driven.
* 3 main types: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
#### Supervised Machine Learning

* Good for when you have large amounts of labeled data that precisely represents what you want to learn.
* Classification - find a decision boundary IOT predict discrete class labels
* Regression - find a "best fit" function IOTT predict continuous valueshat *
