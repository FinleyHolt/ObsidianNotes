### Introduction to Machine Learning

**Artificial Intelligence** — machines or computers that mimic human intelligence through behaviors which are typically associated with cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving.

* Narrow AI replicate human intelligence on specific tasks or in a limited environment
* Machine learning is a family of algorithms that perform tasks without needing the algorithm to be explicitly programmed by a human. Instead, the decisions of the algorithm are governed by rules that are data driven
* Three main types: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement

### Supervised Machine Learning

Good for when you have large amounts of labeled data that precisely represents what you want to learn.

* **Classification** — find a decision boundary in order to predict discrete class labels
* **Regression** — find a "best fit" function in order to predict continuous values

### Building a Machine Learning Pipeline

Machine learning is a tool.

**Gathering and Preparing Your Data:**

* What problem am I trying to solve?
* Is ML even the right tool?
* What data do I need?
* Do I have access to it?

1) Extract features
2) Convert to numeric values
3) Normalize

* Data Split
	* Split data into 3 sets:
		*Training: data used to train the model
		* Validation: data used to iteratively evalutate and improve the model
		* Testing: data used to evaluate the final model (hold out -- never use to train!)

* Selecting a model is an art and a science
	* Choose a model type
		* Nearest neighbor
		* Decision tree
		* Support vector machine (SVM)
		* Random forest
		* Neural network
		* ...

	* Choose model parameters
		* Initial weights, hyperparameters
		* Size, depth, # neurons, # neighbors, ...
		* Learning rate, loss function, ...
		* ...

	* Model Validation
		* Validation is used to iteratively evaluate the performance of a trained machine learning model when applied to "new" data.
		* There are lots of evaluation metrics.
		* Training and validation errors can point to whether or model is under-fitting, has an appropriate fit, or is over-fitting.

## Lecture 2: Data Requirements and Conditioning

### Key Questions

* When organizing data, what is the most effective format and why?
* How do missing data affect downstream processing and results?
* How may unbalanced data cause unintended bias?
* What is the value of outliers in a dataset?
