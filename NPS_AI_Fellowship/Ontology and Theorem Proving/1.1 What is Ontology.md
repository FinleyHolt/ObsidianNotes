> What are two important features of an ontology?
> 1. It is important for an ontology to be expressive, so that you can say anything you want to say while capturing fine distinctions about meaning or how the world works.
> 2. An ontology provided a formal language to provide shared meaning between both computers and people and well as between computers.

* Shared meaning
	* between computers and people
	* between computers
* Symbols - words (and other symbols) are an index or pointer to thoughts and information
* A computer (or, often, another human) doesn't have the same information or thinks the pointer is to another set of information
* Index fail example: "I see Buffalo" can point to an animal or the city in New York (go Bills) word sense disambiguation
* Programming languages have types but this is short of the rich context of language
* Shared meaning requirements:
	* To be able to say everything you want to say - "expressivity"
	* To have said (or defined) a lot of things already
* What is ontology?
	* A dictionary for computers to read
	* What's a good dictionary?
		* Big
		* Expressive - you can say anything you want to say, to capture fine distinctions about meaning or how the world works
	* And a good ontology is both those things plus it's in a formal language that a computer can work with
