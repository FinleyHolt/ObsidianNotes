#### Technology Map: Semantics

* Structure databases
	* Ensure that all fields are clear and consistent
	* Rearden database consistent with SUMO
* Expose features
	* Finding correlations only possible when features that correlate are exposed
		* Abstraction based on superclass etc
* Capture knowledge
	* Express in a computable language knowledge extracted from text
* Inference
	* Deduce new facts from existing facts and rules

#### Applied Philosophy

#### Semantics and OOP

* Things like OWL and OOP try to address the way things are related but run into limitations such as the constraint to binary relationships makes it challenging to state that something is between two other things (a ternary relationship).
* There are challenges with high order logic like saying "I believe John has a Dog"
#### Development Philosophy for SUMO

* Implementation is different from representation
* Sacrifices were not made due to lack of compute hardware currently able to support the chosen representation
* Hardware has caught up to their representation enabling a rich implementation
#### Upper Ontology

* An attempt to capture the most general and reusable terms and definitions
* Provokes thought on clarifying the meaning of more specific terms
* Provides for large-scale reuse*
#### Ontology vs Language and Knowledge
