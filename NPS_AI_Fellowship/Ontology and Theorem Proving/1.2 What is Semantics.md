> Are regular expressions a formal language?
> The set of all valid regular expressions forms a formal language because there is a consistent and unambiguous syntax that defines which strings are valid regular expressions, enabling computation.

* Static Signs and Symbols
	* Seeing a stop sign at an intersection: The word and symbol mean that at this road intersection I should stop my car and make sure it is safe to proceed.
	* Understanding of the symbol by an agent.
	* A sign in Russian would lead to no understanding by the agent
* Simulation - symbols in a simulation can be interpreted to make a prediction about the real world.

Language Inventory
* Do you have all the symbols you need?
* Does your computational system operate on those symbols in the same way you do?
* Is there a formal system?
* Is the system correct?
* Can you say everything you want to say in the system?
	* Without recourse to human intuition
* What is the predictive value of the system?
