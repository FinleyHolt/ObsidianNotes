## SUMOjEdit

### Problem Statement

* Write statements in logic
* An expressive logic (a HOL) so visual/graph editing not possible
* Big library of theories so remembering/checking types and signatures are important
* Need to make it easier for newcomers to write correct code
* Primarily use automated theorem proving, but using them like interactive theorem provers can be helpful

### Theory Library

**Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO)**

* Started in year 2000, open source
* 20,000 terms, 80,000 statements
* Dozens of domain ontologies
* Mapped to GlobalWordNet for NLP applications

### Sigma Knowledge Engineering Environment

* Co-evolved with SUMO since inception
* Browsing, error checking
* Translation from SUMO into TPTP, TF0, THF
* Interface to E from Vampire and SystemOnTPTP
* Reused for SUMOjEdit

### Editor Features

* Color coding — logical operators, fundamental relations, docs
* Errors and warnings
* Formatting
* Open browser
* Go to definition
* Theorem proving

### Theorem Proving Interface

* Highlight any statement
* Converted to TPTP
* Sent to E or Vampire
* Proof converted back to SUO-KIF/SUMO
